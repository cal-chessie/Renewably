| 8 | **SEAI Documents Deletable by Any** | ✅ FIXED | Restricted to uploaders and admins |
| 9 | **Project Documents Deletable by Any** | ✅ FIXED | Restricted to uploaders and admins |

### Recommended RLS Policy Fixes

```sql
-- Fix profiles table - require authentication
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all profiles" ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view profiles" ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Fix contracts table - role-based access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view all contracts" ON public.contracts;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view related contracts" ON public.contracts
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT consultant_id FROM proposals WHERE id = contracts.proposal_id
    ) OR
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')
  );

-- Fix invoices table - role-based access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view all invoices" ON public.invoices;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view related invoices" ON public.invoices
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM proposals p 
      WHERE p.id = invoices.proposal_id 
      AND (p.consultant_id = auth.uid() OR p.assigned_installer_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM installers WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      ))
    ) OR
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')
  );
```

## 2. CODE QUALITY AUDIT

### Architecture Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Component Structure | ✅ Good | Well-organized with focused components |
| State Management | ✅ Good | Appropriate use of React hooks and Supabase |
| TypeScript Usage | ⚠️ Fair | Some `any` types remain in dashboard components |
| Error Handling | ⚠️ Fair | Error boundaries exist but not comprehensive |
| Performance | ✅ Good | Real-time subscriptions, pagination implemented |
| Mobile Responsiveness | ✅ Good | Mobile-first design with safe area handling |

### Code Smells Identified

1. **Large Components**: `PremiumDashboard.tsx` and `InstallerDashboard.tsx` could be further modularized
2. **Type Safety**: Some components use `any` type for assignments, leads, proposals
3. **Magic Strings**: Status values ('pending', 'accepted', etc.) should be enums
4. **Duplicate Logic**: Status color/icon logic repeated across components

### Recommendations

```typescript
// Create shared status configuration
// src/lib/statusConfig.ts
export const ASSIGNMENT_STATUS = {
  PENDING: 'pending',
  ACCEPTED: 'accepted',
  IN_PROGRESS: 'in_progress',
  COMPLETED: 'completed',
  CANCELLED: 'cancelled',
} as const;

export type AssignmentStatus = typeof ASSIGNMENT_STATUS[keyof typeof ASSIGNMENT_STATUS];

export const getStatusConfig = (status: AssignmentStatus) => ({
  pending: { bg: 'bg-yellow-500', label: 'Pending', icon: 'Clock' },
  accepted: { bg: 'bg-blue-500', label: 'Accepted', icon: 'CheckCircle' },
  in_progress: { bg: 'bg-purple-500', label: 'In Progress', icon: 'Zap' },
  completed: { bg: 'bg-green-500', label: 'Completed', icon: 'CheckCircle' },
  cancelled: { bg: 'bg-red-500', label: 'Cancelled', icon: 'XCircle' },
}[status]);
```
